\title{Robust Linear Regression Normalization of NormalyzerDE.}
\usage{
rlrNorm(se, ain = "log2", aout = "Rlr", on_raw = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{se}{SummarizedExperiment containing all necessary information of the proteomic dataset}

\item{ain}{String which assay should be used as input}

\item{aout}{String which assay should be used to save normalized data}

\item{on_raw}{Boolean specifying whether normalization should be performed on raw or log2-scaled data}
}
\value{
SummarizedExperiment containing the rlr normalized data as assay (on log2 scale)
}
\description{
Uses median values over all samples as reference
sample to which all the other samples in the data are normalized to. Log2 data should be taken as input (on_raw = FALSE).
}
\examples{
data(PRONE_example_real_se)
se <- rlrNorm(se, ain = "log2", aout = "Rlr", on_raw = FALSE)
