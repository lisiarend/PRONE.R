\title{Cyclic Linear Regression Normalization on MA Transformed Data}
\usage{
rlrMACycNorm(
  se,
  ain = "log2",
  aout = "RlrMACyc",
  on_raw = FALSE,
  iterations = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{se}{SummarizedExperiment containing all necessary information of the proteomic dataset}

\item{ain}{String which assay should be used as input}

\item{aout}{String which assay should be used to save normalized data}

\item{on_raw}{Boolean specifying whether normalization should be performed on raw or log2-scaled data}

\item{iterations}{Number of cyclic iterations to be performed}
}
\value{
SummarizedExperiment containing the RlrMACyc normalized data as assay (on log2 scale)
}
\description{
No reference, but MA transformation and normalization
of samples is done pairwise between two samples with A = average of two samples and M = difference. The process is iterated through all samples pairs.
Log2 data should be taken as input (on_raw = FALSE).
}
\examples{
data(PRONE_example_real_se)
se <- rlrMACycNorm(se, ain = "log2", aout = "RlrMACyc", on_raw = FALSE, iterations=3)
