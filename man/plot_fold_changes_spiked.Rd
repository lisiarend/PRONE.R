\title{Boxplot of log fold changes of spike-in and background proteins for specific normalization methods and comparisons. The ground truth (calculated based on the concentrations of the spike-ins) is shown as a horizontal line.}
\usage{

}
\arguments{
\item{se}{SummarizedExperiment containing all necessary information of the proteomics data set}

\item{de_res}{data table resulting of run_DE}

\item{condition}{column name of condition (if NULL, condition saved in SummarizedExperiment will be taken)}

\item{ain}{Vector of strings of normalization methods to visualize (must be valid normalization methods saved in stats)}

\item{comparisons}{Vector of comparisons (must be valid comparisons saved in stats)}
}
\value{
ggplot object
